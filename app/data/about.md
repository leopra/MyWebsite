#### Intro
<br>
Hello there,

I am a Computer Scientist with a specialization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Over the past three years, I have developed a deep fondness for NLP techniques and have been continuously expanding my knowledge in this field. Alongside this, I have also developed a passion for MLops practices and software optimization, recognizing the importance of efficiently deploying and managing machine learning models.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working in multiple AI-based startups, where I have honed my technical proficiency. Python is a language I am highly proficient in, and I leverage it to its fullest potential in my work. Additionally, I possess expertise in Big Data Processing and Full Stack Development, enabling me to tackle end-to-end AI projects with ease. One of my strengths is my ability to work in a fast-paced environment. 
As a machine learning engineer in multiple startups, I had to quickly adapt to changing requirements and tight deadlines. This experience has made me comfortable working under pressure and has taught me to be resourceful when faced with unexpected challenges.

Currently, I am actively seeking exciting opportunities in challenging and fast-growing companies. I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation is valued, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to drive impactful solutions. If you are looking for a dedicated and knowledgeable professional who can make significant contributions in the realms of NLP, machine learning, and software optimization.

When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me in the lineup, riding waves and experiencing the pure exhilaration that surfing brings.
